| NAME                   | PROMPT                                                                                                                         | DESCRIPTION                                              | EXAMPLE |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `app.yaml`             | Generate a Kubernetes manifest for Pod named "app" with container "app" from image "gcr.io/k8s-k3s/demo:v1.0.0", exposing port 8000, named "http". Add labels "app=demo", "run=demo". | Basic single-container Pod manifest.                    | [app.yaml](./yaml/app.yaml) |
| `app-livenessProbe.yaml` | Generate a Kubernetes manifest for Pod named "app" with container "app" from image "gcr.io/k8s-k3s/demo:v1.0.0", exposing port 8000, named "http". Add labels "app=demo", "run=demo". Add a "livenessProbe" to the "app" container in "app.yaml" that hits "/healthz" via HTTP GET on port 8000 every 10 seconds.     | Adds health check for auto-restart if unresponsive.     | [app-livenessProbe.yaml](./yaml/app-livenessProbe.yaml) |
| `app-readinessProbe.yaml` |Generate a Kubernetes manifest for Pod named "app" with container "app" from image "gcr.io/k8s-k3s/demo:v1.0.0", exposing port 8000, named "http". Add labels "app=demo", "run=demo". Add a "livenessProbe" to the "app" container in "app.yaml" that hits "/healthz" via HTTP GET on port 8000 every 10 seconds. Add a "readinessProbe" to the "app" container in "app.yaml" that checks "/ready" with 5s initial delay and 1s period.         | Controls traffic routing based on readiness.            | [app-readinessProbe.yaml](./yaml/app-readinessProbe.yaml) |
| `app-volumeMounts.yaml`  | Generate a Kubernetes manifest for Pod named "app" with container "app" from image "gcr.io/k8s-k3s/demo:v1.0.0", exposing port 8000, named "http". Add labels "app=demo", "run=demo". Add a "livenessProbe" to the "app" container in "app.yaml" that hits "/healthz" via HTTP GET on port 8000 every 10 seconds. Add a "readinessProbe" to the "app" container in "app.yaml" that checks "/ready" with 5s initial delay and 1s period. Mount an "emptyDir" volume named "cache-volume" to path "/cache" in "app" container.                                          | Example of ephemeral volume usage in a Pod.             | [app-volumeMounts.yaml](./yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml) |
| `app-cronjob.yaml`       | Generate a Kubernetes manifest for CronJob named "app-cronjob" that runs the command "echo "Hello world"" every 5 minutes using the "bash" image. The container should be named "hello", and the restart policy must be "OnFailure".                         | Schedules periodic background job.                      | [app-cronjob.yaml](./yaml/app-cronjob.yaml) |
| `app-job.yaml`           | Generate a Kubernetes manifest for Job named "app-job-rsync" that runs the command "gsutil -m rsync -dr gs://glow-sportradar/ /data/input" using the "google/cloud-sdk:275.0.0-alpine" image. Mount a GCE persistent disk named "glow-data-disk-200" with "ext4" filesystem to "/data/input" via a volume named "data-input". Use container name "init", restart policy "Never", and set "backoffLimit" to 0.                                          | One-time execution example.                             | [app-job.yaml](./yaml/app-job.yaml) |
| `app-multicontainer.yaml` | Generate a Kubernetes manifest for Pod named "app-multi-containers" with two containers: the first uses the "nginx" image and mounts an "emptyDir" volume named "html" to "/usr/share/nginx/html"; the second uses the "debian" image, mounts the same volume to "/html", and runs a loop that appends the current date to "/html/index.html" every second.                                 | Demonstrates sidecar pattern using shared volumes.      | [app-multicontainer.yaml](./yaml/app-multicontainer.yaml) |
| `app-resources.yaml`     | Generate a Kubernetes manifest for Pod named "app" with container "app" from image "gcr.io/k8s-k3s/demo:v1.0.0", exposing port 8000, named "http". Add labels "app=demo", "run=demo". Add a "livenessProbe" to the "app" container in "app.yaml" that hits "/healthz" via HTTP GET on port 8000 every 10 seconds. Add a "readinessProbe" to the "app" container in "app.yaml" that checks "/ready" with 5s initial delay and 1s period. Set CPU/memory requests and limits for "app" container: 100m/128Mi request, 500m/512Mi limit.                                 | Enforces resource constraints and QoS.                  | [app-resources.yaml](./yaml/app-resources.yaml) |
| `app-secret-env.yaml`        | Generate a Kubernetes manifest for Pod named "app-secret-env" with a container named "mycontainer" using the "redis" image. Configure two environment variables: "SECRET_USERNAME" and "SECRET_PASSWORD", both sourced from the Secret named "mysecret1", using keys "username" and "password" respectively.               | Injects sensitive data via env vars from Secret.        | [app-secret.yaml](./yaml/app-secret.yaml) |
